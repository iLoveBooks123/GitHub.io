      <p>Here are some initiatives we’ve created to spread awareness and promote well-being.</p>

        <h3>21 days of Self-Care Mood-Boosting Activities</h3>
        <p>The 21-day mood-boosting self-care campaign, from November 1 to November 21, was designed to help people build consistent habits for supporting mental well-being. Research suggests it takes about three weeks to start forming a habit, so focusing on daily mood-boosting activities for this period encourages positive behaviors that improves mood, reduces stress, and promotes resilience.
            This structured approach also gives people a chance to discover self-care techniques that work best for them and helps lay a foundation for lasting mental wellness.</p>

        <h3>Event - Calming and Wellness Activity</h3>
        <p>This event was organized to create a supportive and engaging environment for learning about mood disorders, while also encouraging self-care and mental wellness. The presentation offered quick, accessible information to raise awareness, while the calming activities—like mandala coloring and affirmation poster-making—provided students with tools for relaxation and positive self-expression. By including fun games and snacks, we aimed to make mental health education approachable and enjoyable, helping students connect with each other and develop wellness strategies they can use beyond the event.

        <h3>Encouragement card making</h3>
        <p>Our Encouragement Card Session was a heartwarming initiative aimed at spreading positivity and support within our school community and beyond. During flex, students came together to create over 100 uplifting cards, which we sent to Inspiring My Generation, an organization dedicated to mental health advocacy. To show our appreciation for those who participated, we prepared special goody bags filled with candy, a small toy, and a Shades of Emotion tag; our way of reminding them that support goes both ways. This session not only allowed us to encourage others but also reinforced the importance of kindness, connection, and emotional well-being within our own school.</p>

        <h3>Middle School Presentation</h3>
        <p>Our Middle School Presentation was an exciting opportunity to educate younger students about mood disorders and mental health awareness. As we presented, we were thrilled to see how engaged they were, with many students actively participating and sharing what they had already learned, highlighting how schools have been incorporating mental health education from an early age. To make learning more interactive, we played a game called blooket to test their understanding and wrapped up the session with a questionnaire to gather their thoughts. Additionally, we spoke with Dr. Gordon to explore effective ways to approach younger audiences through our Shades of Emotion podcast, ensuring that mental health education continues to be accessible and relatable from an early age.</p>

      <h3>Friday Affirmations</h3>
      <p>Our Friday Affirmations event was a simple yet impactful way to support students as they prepared for the upcoming testing season. We created and distributed affirmation cards with uplifting messages to over 80 students, reminding them that they are capable, strong, and ready to succeed. To make the gesture even sweeter, we also handed out candy along with the affirmations. Walking around the school and personally delivering these words of encouragement allowed us to spread positivity and reassurance, ensuring that every student knew they had a support system cheering them on.</p>

      <p>Our Shades of Emotion Brochure is a guide to help students understand mood disorders. It covers definitions, symptoms, causes, and factors that affect mental health. It also offers tips for managing mental health and provides helplines for support. The brochure was reviewed and approved by our HOSA officer, vice principal, school medical teacher, and HOSA advisor to ensure it’s accurate and trustworthy. Now available in the main office, this resource is easily accessible for anyone looking to learn more about mood disorders and ways to support themselves or others.</p>

      <h3>Bulletin Board</h3>
      <p>Our Shades of Emotion Bulletin Board is an interactive space for students to learn about mood disorders and mental well-being. It includes a Myth vs. Fact section to clear up common misconceptions, along with information on mood disorders, symptoms, treatment options, and prevention tips. We also featured different therapy options to encourage exploration of support. To engage students, we added an affirmation area, journals, and self-care bingo cards. QR codes link to our Shades of Emotion resources, helplines, and support networks, while a Mood Wheel helps students better understand their emotions. This bulletin board offers helpful tools and spreads awareness about mental health.</p>

      <h3>Brooch pins making</h3>
      <p>Our Brooch Pin Event was a creative and meaningful way to raise awareness for mental health while engaging in a relaxing, hands-on activity. Students designed and crafted unique safety pin brooches adorned with charms, incorporating our campaign colors blue, purple, green, and grey to symbolize different aspects of mental health awareness. The event highlighted how even art-based activities can be powerful tools for advocacy, as students proudly pinned their creations onto their bags, sparking conversations about mental health in an everyday setting. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many participants expressing how much they enjoyed making these cute, personalized pins and hoping for more calming, creative events in the future.</p>
